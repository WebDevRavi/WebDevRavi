        What is Fitness?
    </h1>
    <div class="answer__description">"Fitness" is a broad term that means something different to each person, but it
        refers to your own optimal health and overall well-being. Being fit not only means physical health, but
        emotional and mental health, too. It defines every aspect of your health. Smart eating and active living are
        fundamental to fitness.<br>
        <br> According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Complete Food and Nutrition Guide (3rd ed.), when you
        are fit, you have:<br>
        <ul>
            <li> Energy to do what's important to you and to be more productive</li>
            <li> Stamina and a positive outlook to handle the mental challenges and emotional ups and downs of everyday
                life and to deal with stress</li>
            <li> Reduced risk for many health problems, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis</li>
            <li> The chance to look and feel your best</li>
            <li> Physical strength and endurance to accomplish physical challenges</li>
            <li> A better chance for a higher quality of life and perhaps a longer life, too</li>
        </ul>

            <li>At least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or
                an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity</li>
            <li>Strength training exercises of all the major muscle groups at least twice a week</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regular exercise can help you control your weight, reduce your risk of heart disease and certain cancers, and
            strengthen your bones and muscles. But if you haven't exercised for some time and you have health concerns,
            you may want to talk to your doctor before starting a new fitness routine.</p>
        <p>When you're designing your personal fitness program, consider your fitness goals. Think about your fitness
            likes and dislikes, and note your personal barriers to fitness. Then consider practical strategies for
            keeping your fitness program on track.</p>
        <p>Starting a fitness program is an important decision, but it doesn't have to be an overwhelming one. By
            planning carefully and pacing yourself, you can make fitness a healthy habit that lasts a lifetime.</p>

        <h2>Exercise and Sleep Have a Very Intimate Relationship. Here’s How They Both Play a Role in Overall Fitness
        </h2>
        <p>
            Think about it this way: Even a marathon runner who fits in multiple strength-training workouts per week can
            throw off their fitness by eating a diet of highly processed foods that are low in nutrients and high in
            saturated fats and sugars. Similarly, someone with stellar workout and diet habits can sidetrack their
            fitness by not logging a consistently healthy amount of sleep each night.

    <h1>Chakras</h1>
    <p>The word “chakra” means “spinning wheel.”</p>
    <p>Yoga maintains that chakras are center points of energy, thoughts, feelings, and the physical body. According to
        yogic teachers, chakras determine how people experience reality through emotional reactions, desires or
        aversions, levels of confidence or fear, and even physical symptoms and effects.</p>
    <p>When energy becomes blocked in a chakra, it triggers physical, mental, or emotional imbalances that manifest in
        symptoms such as anxiety, lethargy, or poor digestion.</p>
    <p>Asanas are the many physical poses in Hatha yoga. People who practice yoga use asanas to free energy and
        stimulate an imbalanced chakra.</p>
    <p>There are seven major chakras, each with its own focus:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sahasrara:</strong> The crown chakra, which is at the crown of the head, symbolizes spiritual
            connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Ajna:</strong> Located between the eyebrows, the third eye chakra has to do with intuition.</li>
        <li><strong>Vishuddha:</strong> The throat chakra corresponds to immunity and verbal communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Anahata:</strong> The heart chakra, which is in the center of the chest, influences professional and
            personal relationships. Any imbalances in this chakra will affect oxygen,tissue, and organ control.</li>
        <li><strong>Manipura:</strong> The solar plexus chakra is in the stomach area. It corresponds to
            self-confidence, wisdom, and self-discipline.</li>
        <li><strong>Svadhishthana:</strong> The sacral chakra, which is beneath the belly button, connects pleasure,
            well-being, and vitality.</li>
        <li><strong>Muladhara:</strong> The root chakra, which is at the base of the spine, connects the mind and body
            to the earth to keep a person grounded. It controls the sciatic nerves and the parasympathetic nervous
            system.</li>
    </ul>
